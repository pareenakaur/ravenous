<strong>Purpose of the Project</strong><br>
In this project, I built a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses using their location and keywords.
<br><br><strong>Technologies Used</strong><br>
This was implemented using a tech stack consisting of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Yelp API. 
<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>
The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content. Users can query for a restaurant and also view a list of businesses that match their query, sorted by best match, highest rated, or most reviews. They can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation. Information is transferred efficiently between components using a uni-directional data flow pattern commonly used in React applications.
<br><br><strong>Future Work</strong><br>
I plan to improve the application by enhancing the user interface and giving users more information about their favourite eateries. Some of the improvements I aim to work on include:
<ul>
  <li>Implementing my own type of sort (by distance or cost, etc)</li>
  <li>Allow users to click on the image or the address to get more information on the business (view the business website, or display business location in Google Maps)</li>
  <li>Improve user interface - allow users to press enter to submit their search query instead of pressing a submit button, users can switch between sort options and see business info resorted without having to press the submit button again, implementing auto-completion for business/location inputs</li>
</ul>
